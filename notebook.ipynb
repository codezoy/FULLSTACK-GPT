       "\"To make Italian pasta, you will need the following ingredients:\\n\\n- 2 cups of all-purpose flour\\n- 2 large eggs\\n- 1/2 teaspoon of salt\\n- Water (if needed)\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step guide to making Italian pasta:\\n\\n1. On a clean surface or in a large mixing bowl, pour the flour and create a well in the center.\\n2. Crack the eggs into the well and add the salt.\\n3. Using a fork or your fingers, gradually mix the eggs and salt into the flour, incorporating a little bit at a time.\\n4. Once the dough starts to come together, knead it with your hands until it forms a smooth and elastic ball. If the dough feels too dry, you can add a little water, one tablespoon at a time, until it reaches the desired consistency.\\n5. Once the dough is formed, cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rest for about 30 minutes. This will allow the gluten to relax and make the dough easier to work with.\\n6. After resting, divide the dough into smaller portions. You can use a pasta machine or a rolling pin to roll out the dough into thin sheets. If using a pasta machine, start with the widest setting and gradually decrease the thickness until you reach the desired thickness for your pasta.\\n7. Once the dough is rolled out, you can cut it into your desired pasta shape. Common shapes include fettuccine, spaghetti, lasagna sheets, or ravioli squares.\\n8. If making long pasta shapes like spaghetti or fettuccine, you can hang them on a drying rack or lay them flat on a clean surface to dry for a few minutes before cooking.\\n9. To cook the pasta, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, which means it should still have a slight bite to it. The cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of your pasta, so it's best to taste it as it cooks.\\n10. Once cooked, drain the pasta and toss it with your favorite sauce or toppings. Serve immediately and enjoy your homemade Italian pasta!\\n\\nNote: If you don't have the time or resources to make fresh pasta from scratch, you can also use store-bought dried pasta, which is readily available in most grocery stores.\""

       "\"To make Italian pasta, you will need the following ingredients:\\n\\n- 2 cups of all-purpose flour\\n- 2 large eggs\\n- 1/2 teaspoon of salt\\n- Water (if needed)\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step guide to making Italian pasta:\\n\\n1. On a clean surface or in a large mixing bowl, pour the flour and create a well in the center.\\n2. Crack the eggs into the well and add the salt.\\n3. Using a fork or your fingers, gradually mix the eggs and salt into the flour, incorporating a little bit at a time.\\n4. Once the dough starts to come together, knead it with your hands until it forms a smooth and elastic ball. If the dough feels too dry, you can add a little water, one tablespoon at a time, until it reaches the desired consistency.\\n5. Once the dough is formed, cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rest for about 30 minutes. This will allow the gluten to relax and make the dough easier to work with.\\n6. After resting, divide the dough into smaller portions. You can use a pasta machine or a rolling pin to roll out the dough into thin sheets. If using a pasta machine, start with the widest setting and gradually decrease the thickness until you reach the desired thickness for your pasta.\\n7. Once the dough is rolled out, you can cut it into your desired pasta shape. Common shapes include fettuccine, spaghetti, lasagna sheets, or ravioli squares.\\n8. If making long pasta shapes like spaghetti or fettuccine, you can hang them on a drying rack or lay them flat on a clean surface to dry for a few minutes before cooking.\\n9. To cook the pasta, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, which means it should still have a slight bite to it. The cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of your pasta, so it's best to taste it as it cooks.\\n10. Once cooked, drain the pasta and toss it with your favorite sauce or toppings. Serve immediately and enjoy your homemade Italian pasta!\\n\\nNote: If you don't have the time or resources to make fresh pasta from scratch, you can also use store-bought dried pasta, which is readily available in most grocery stores.\""

       "[Document(page_content='DEMI AN \\n\\n* \\n\\n\\n\\nHERMANN \\n\\nHESSE \\n\\nDEMIAN \\n\\n* \\n\\n\\nTranslated by W. J. Strachan \\n\\n\\n\\nLondon \\n\\n\\n\\nPrologue \\n\\n\\nI cannot tell my story without going a long way back. \\nIf it were possible I would go back much farther still to \\nthe very earliest years of my childhood and beyond them \\nto my family origins. \\n\\nWhen poets write novels they are apt to behave as if \\nthey were gods, with the power to look beyond and com- \\nprehend any human story and serve it up as if the \\nAlmighty himself, omnipresent, were relating it in all \\nits naked truth. That I am no more able to do than the \\npoets. But my story is more important to me than any \\npoet’s story to him, for it is my own — and it is the story \\nof a human being — not an invented, idealised person \\nbut a real, live, unique being. What constitutes a real, \\nlive human being is more of a mystery than ever these \\ndays, and men — each one of whom is a valuable, unique \\nexperiment on the part of nature — are shot down whole- \\nsale. If, however, we were not something more than \\nunique human beings and each man jack of us could \\nreally be dismissed from this world with a bullet, there \\nwould be no more point in relating stories at all. But \\nevcpy man is not only himself; he is also the unique, \\nparticular, always significant and remarkable point \\nwhere the phenomena of the world intersect once and \\nfor all and never again. That is why every man’s story \\n\\n\\n5 \\n\\n\\n\\nDEMIAN \\n\\n\\nis important, eternal, sacred; and why every man while \\nhe lives and fulfils the will of nature is a wonderful \\ncreature, deserving the utmost attention. In each indi- \\nvidual the spirit is made -flesh, in each one the whole of \\ncreation suffers, in each one a Saviour is crucified. \\n\\nFew people nowadays know what man is. Many feel it \\nintuitively and die more easily for that reason, just as I \\nshall die more easily when I have completed this story. \\n\\nI cannot call myself a scholar. I have always been and \\nstill am a seeker but I no longer do my seeking among \\nthe stars or in books. I am beginning to hear the lessons \\nwhich whisper in my blood. Mine is not a pleasant story, \\nit does not possess the gentle harmony of invented tales; \\nlike the lives of all men who have given up trying to \\ndeceive themselves, it is a mixture of nonsense and \\nchaos, madness and dreams. \\n\\nThe life of every man is a way to himself, an attempt \\nat a way, the suggestion of a path. No man has ever \\nbeen utterly himself, yet every man strives to be so, the \\ndull, the intelligent, each one as best he can. Each man \\nto the end of his days carries round with him vestiges \\nof his birth — the slime and egg-shells of the primeval \\nworld. There are many who never become human; they \\nremain frogs, lizards, ants. Many men are human beings \\nabove and fish below. Yet each one represents an attempt \\non the part of nature to create a human being. We \\nenjoy a common origin in our mothers; we all come \\nfrom the same pit. But each individual, who is himself \\nan experimental throw from the depths, strives towards \\nhis own goal. We can understand each other; but each \\nperson is able to interpret himself to himself alone. \\n\\n6 \\n\\n\\n\\nI \\n\\n\\nTwo Worlds \\n\\n\\nI begin my story with an event from the time when I \\nwas ten years old, attending the local grammar school \\nin our small country town. \\n\\nI can still catch the fragrance of many things which \\nstir me with feelings of melancholy and send delicious \\nshivers of delight through me — dark and sunlit streets, \\nhouses and towers, clock chimes and people’s faces, rooms \\nfull of comfort and warm hospitality, rooms full of \\nsecret and profound, ghostly fears. It is a world that \\nsavours of warm corners, rabbits, servant girls, household \\nremedies and dried fruit. It was the meeting-place of two \\nworlds; day and night came thither from two opposite \\npoles. \\n\\nThere was the world of my parents\\' house, or rather it \\nwas even more circumscribed and embraced only my \\nparents themselves. This world was familiar to me in \\nalmost every aspect — it meant mother and father, love \\nand severity, model behaviour and school. It was a world \\nof quiet brilliance, clarity and cleanliness; in it gentle \\nand friendly conversation, washed hands, clean clothes \\nand good manners were the order of the day. In this \\nworld the morning hymn was sung, Christmas celebrated. \\nThrough it ran straight lines and paths that led into the \\nfuture; here were duty and guilt, bad conscience and \\n\\n\\n7 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDEMI AN \\n\\n\\nconfessions, forgiveness and good resolutions, love and \\nreverence, wisdom and Bible readings. In this world you \\nhad to conduct yourself so that life should be pure, \\nunsullied, beautiful and Well-ordered. \\n\\nThe other world, however, also began in the middle \\nof our own house and was completely different; it smelt \\ndifferent, spoke a different language, made different \\nclaims and promises. This second world was peopled \\nwith servant girls and workmen, ghost stories and scan- \\ndalous rumours, a gay tide of monstrous, intriguing, \\nfrightful, mysterious things; it included the slaughter- \\nhouse and the prison, drunken and scolding women, \\ncows in labour, foundered horses, tales of housebreaking, \\nmurder and suicide. All these attractive and hideous, \\nwild and cruel things were on every side, in the next \\nstreet, the neighbouring house. Policemen and tramps \\nmoved about in it, drunkards beat their wives, bunches \\nof young women poured out of the factories in the even- \\ning, old women could put a spell on you and make you \\nill; thieves lived in the wood; incendiaries were caught \\nby mounted gendarmes. Everywhere you could smell this \\nvigorous, second world — everywhere, that is, except in \\nour house where my mother and father lived. There it \\nwas all goodness. It was wonderful to be living in a \\nhouse in a reign of peace, order, tranquillity, duty and \\ngood conscience, forgiveness and love — but it was no less \\nwonderful to know there was the other, the loud and \\nshrill, sullen and violent world from which you could \\ndart back to your mother in one leap. \\n\\nThe odd thing about it was that these worlds should \\nborder on each other so closely. When, for example, our \\n\\n\\n8 \\n\\n\\n\\nTWO WORLDS \\n\\n\\nservant Lina sat by the door in the living-room at even- \\ning prayers and joined in the hymn in her dear voice, \\nher freshly washed hands folded on her smoothed down \\npinafore, she belonged wholly and utterly to mother \\nand father, to us, the world of light and righteousness. \\nBut when in the kitchen or woodshed immediately after- \\nwards she told me the story of the little headless man or \\nstarted bickering with her neighbours in the little \\nbutcher’s shop, she became a different person, belonged \\nto another world and was veiled in mystery. And it was \\nthe same with everybody, most of all with myself. Doubt- \\nless I was part of the world of light and righteousness \\nas the child of my parents, but wherever I listened or \\ndirected my gaze I found the other thing and I lived \\nhalf in the other world, although it was often strangely \\nalien to me and I inevitably suffered from panic and a \\nbad conscience. Indeed at times I preferred life in the \\nforbidden world and my return to the world of light — \\nnecessary and worthy though it might be — was often \\nalmost like a return something less attractive, some- \\nthing both more drab and tedious. I was often conscious \\nthat my destiny in life was to become like my father \\nand mother; pure, righteous and disciplined; but that \\nwas a long way ahead; first one had to sit studying at \\nschool, do tests and examinations, and the way always \\nled through and past the other, dark world and it was \\nnot impossible that one might remain permanently in \\nit. I had read, with passionate interest, stories of prodigal \\nsons to whom this had happened. There was always the \\nreturn to their father and the path of righteousness that \\nwas so fine and redeeming that I felt convinced that this \\n\\n\\n9 \\n\\n\\n\\nDEMI AN \\n\\n\\nalone was the right, good, worthy thing; and yet I found \\nthe part of the story which was played among the wicked \\nand lost souls far more, alluring. *If it had been per- \\nmissible to speak out and confess, I should have admitted \\nthat it often seemed a shame to me that the Prodigal \\nSon should atone and be ‘found’ again — though this \\nfeeling was only vaguely present deep down within me \\nlike a presentiment or possibility. When I pictured the \\ndevil to myself, I found no difficulty in visualizing him \\nin the street below, disguised or undisguised, or at the \\nfair or in a tavern but never at home. \\n\\nMy sisters belonged likewise to the world of light. It \\noften seemed to me that they were closer in temperament \\nto father and mother, better and more refined and with \\nfewer faults than I. Of course they had their defects and \\ntheir vagaries but these did not appear to me to go very \\ndeep. It was not as with me whose contact with evil \\ncould become so oppressive and painful and to whom \\nthe dark world lay so much closer. My sisters, like my \\nparents, were to be spared and respected, and if one \\nquarrelled with them one always felt in the wrong after- \\nwards; as if one were the instigator, who must crave \\nforgiveness. For in offending my sisters, I was offending \\nmy parents, which made me guilty of a breach of good \\nconduct. There were secrets that I would have been less \\nreluctant to tell the most reprobate street urchin than \\nmy sisters.

How rarely did such hours and days come along! \\n\\nI would often be engaged in some harmless and author- \\nized game which became too exciting and vigorous for \\nmy sisters and led to squabbles and misery, and when I \\nlost my temper I was terrible and did and said things \\nthat seemed so depraved to me that they seared my heart \\neven as I was in the act of doing and saying them. These \\noccasions were followed by gloomy hours of sorrow and \\npenitence and the painful moment when I begged for- \\ngiveness and then, once again, a beam of light, a tran- \\nquil, grateful unclouded goodness for hours — or mom- \\nents as the case might be. \\n\\nI attended the local grammar school. The mayor’s \\nson and the head forester’s son were in my class and \\nsometimes joined me. They were wild fellows, yet they \\nbelonged to the ‘respectable’ world.

Occasionally we came across \\nthings we could make use of. We had to comb these \\nstretches of bank under Franz Kromer’s orders and show \\nhim our discoveries.

       "[Document(page_content='DEMI AN \\n\\nHERMANN \\n\\nHESSE \\n\\nDEMIAN \\n\\nTranslated by W. J. Strachan \\n\\nLondon \\n\\nPrologue \\n\\nI cannot tell my story without going a long way back. \\n\\n\\n\\nIf it were possible I would go back much farther still to \\n\\nthe very earliest years of my childhood and beyond them \\n\\nto my family origins. \\n\\nWhen poets write novels they are apt to behave as if \\n\\nthey were gods, with the power to look beyond and com- \\n\\nprehend any human story and serve it up as if the \\n\\nAlmighty himself, omnipresent, were relating it in all \\n\\nits naked truth. That I am no more able to do than the \\n\\npoets. But my story is more important to me than any \\n\\npoet’s story to him, for it is my own — and it is the story \\n\\nof a human being — not an invented, idealised person \\n\\nbut a real, live, unique being. What constitutes a real, \\n\\nlive human being is more of a mystery than ever these \\n\\ndays, and men — each one of whom is a valuable, unique \\n\\nexperiment on the part of nature — are shot down whole- \\n\\nsale. If, however, we were not something more than \\n\\nunique human beings and each man jack of us could \\n\\nreally be dismissed from this world with a bullet, there \\n\\nwould be no more point in relating stories at all. But \\n\\nevcpy man is not only himself; he is also the unique, \\n\\nparticular, always significant and remarkable point \\n\\nwhere the phenomena of the world intersect once and \\n\\nfor all and never again. That is why every man’s story \\n\\n5 \\n\\nDEMIAN \\n\\nis important, eternal, sacred; and why every man while \\n\\nhe lives and fulfils the will of nature is a wonderful \\n\\ncreature, deserving the utmost attention. In each indi- \\n\\nvidual the spirit is made -flesh, in each one the whole of \\n\\ncreation suffers, in each one a Saviour is crucified. \\n\\nFew people nowadays know what man is. Many feel it \\n\\nintuitively and die more easily for that reason, just as I \\n\\nshall die more easily when I have completed this story. \\n\\nI cannot call myself a scholar. I have always been and \\n\\nstill am a seeker but I no longer do my seeking among \\n\\nthe stars or in books. I am beginning to hear the lessons \\n\\nwhich whisper in my blood. Mine is not a pleasant story, \\n\\nit does not possess the gentle harmony of invented tales; \\n\\nlike the lives of all men who have given up trying to \\n\\ndeceive themselves, it is a mixture of nonsense and \\n\\nchaos, madness and dreams. \\n\\nThe life of every man is a way to himself, an attempt \\n\\nat a way, the suggestion of a path. No man has ever \\n\\nbeen utterly himself, yet every man strives to be so, the \\n\\ndull, the intelligent, each one as best he can. Each man \\n\\nto the end of his days carries round with him vestiges \\n\\nof his birth — the slime and egg-shells of the primeval \\n\\nworld. There are many who never become human; they \\n\\nremain frogs, lizards, ants. Many men are human beings \\n\\nabove and fish below. Yet each one represents an attempt \\n\\non the part of nature to create a human being. We \\n\\nenjoy a common origin in our mothers; we all come \\n\\nfrom the same pit. But each individual, who is himself \\n\\nan experimental throw from the depths, strives towards \\n\\nhis own goal. We can understand each other; but each \\n\\nperson is able to interpret himself to himself alone. \\n\\n6 \\n\\nI \\n\\nTwo Worlds \\n\\nI begin my story with an event from the time when I \\n\\nwas ten years old, attending the local grammar school \\n\\nin our small country town. \\n\\nI can still catch the fragrance of many things which \\n\\nstir me with feelings of melancholy and send delicious \\n\\nshivers of delight through me — dark and sunlit streets, \\n\\nhouses and towers, clock chimes and people’s faces, rooms \\n\\nfull of comfort and warm hospitality, rooms full of \\n\\nsecret and profound, ghostly fears. It is a world that \\n\\nsavours of warm corners, rabbits, servant girls, household \\n\\nremedies and dried fruit. It was the meeting-place of two \\n\\nworlds; day and night came thither from two opposite \\n\\npoles. \\n\\nThere was the world of my parents\\' house, or rather it \\n\\nwas even more circumscribed and embraced only my \\n\\nparents themselves. This world was familiar to me in \\n\\nalmost every aspect — it meant mother and father, love \\n\\nand severity, model behaviour and school. It was a world \\n\\nof quiet brilliance, clarity and cleanliness; in it gentle \\n\\nand friendly conversation, washed hands, clean clothes \\n\\nand good manners were the order of the day. In this \\n\\nworld the morning hymn was sung, Christmas celebrated. \\n\\nThrough it ran straight lines and paths that led into the \\n\\nfuture; here were duty and guilt, bad conscience and \\n\\n\\n\\n7 \\n\\nDEMI AN \\n\\nconfessions, forgiveness and good resolutions, love and \\n\\nreverence, wisdom and Bible readings. In this world you \\n\\nhad to conduct yourself so that life should be pure, \\n\\nunsullied, beautiful and Well-ordered. \\n\\nThe other world, however, also began in the middle \\n\\nof our own house and was completely different; it smelt \\n\\ndifferent, spoke a different language, made different \\n\\nclaims and promises. This second world was peopled \\n\\nwith servant girls and workmen, ghost stories and scan- \\n\\ndalous rumours, a gay tide of monstrous, intriguing, \\n\\nfrightful, mysterious things; it included the slaughter- \\n\\nhouse and the prison, drunken and scolding women, \\n\\ncows in labour, foundered horses, tales of housebreaking, \\n\\nmurder and suicide. All these attractive and hideous, \\n\\nwild and cruel things were on every side, in the next \\n\\n\\n\\nstreet, the neighbouring house. Policemen and tramps \\n\\nmoved about in it, drunkards beat their wives, bunches \\n\\nof young women poured out of the factories in the even- \\n\\ning, old women could put a spell on you and make you \\n\\nill; thieves lived in the wood; incendiaries were caught \\n\\nby mounted gendarmes. Everywhere you could smell this \\n\\nvigorous, second world — everywhere, that is, except in \\n\\nour house where my mother and father lived. There it \\n\\nwas all goodness. It was wonderful to be living in a \\n\\nhouse in a reign of peace, order, tranquillity, duty and \\n\\ngood conscience, forgiveness and love — but it was no less \\n\\nwonderful to know there was the other, the loud and \\n\\nshrill, sullen and violent world from which you could \\n\\ndart back to your mother in one leap. \\n\\nThe odd thing about it was that these worlds should \\n\\nborder on each other so closely. When, for example, our \\n\\n8 \\n\\nTWO WORLDS \\n\\nservant Lina sat by the door in the living-room at even- \\n\\ning prayers and joined in the hymn in her dear voice, \\n\\nher freshly washed hands folded on her smoothed down \\n\\npinafore, she belonged wholly and utterly to mother \\n\\nand father, to us, the world of light and righteousness. \\n\\nBut when in the kitchen or woodshed immediately after- \\n\\nwards she told me the story of the little headless man or \\n\\nstarted bickering with her neighbours in the little \\n\\nbutcher’s shop, she became a different person, belonged \\n\\nto another world and was veiled in mystery. And it was \\n\\nthe same with everybody, most of all with myself. Doubt- \\n\\nless I was part of the world of light and righteousness \\n\\nas the child of my parents, but wherever I listened or \\n\\ndirected my gaze I found the other thing and I lived \\n\\nhalf in the other world, although it was often strangely \\n\\nalien to me and I inevitably suffered from panic and a \\n\\nbad conscience. Indeed at times I preferred life in the \\n\\nforbidden world and my return to the world of light — \\n\\nnecessary and worthy though it might be — was often \\n\\nalmost like a return something less attractive, some- \\n\\nthing both more drab and tedious. I was often conscious \\n\\nthat my destiny in life was to become like my father \\n\\nand mother; pure, righteous and disciplined; but that \\n\\nwas a long way ahead; first one had to sit studying at \\n\\nschool, do tests and examinations, and the way always \\n\\nled through and past the other, dark world and it was \\n\\n\\n\\nnot impossible that one might remain permanently in \\n\\nit. I had read, with passionate interest, stories of prodigal \\n\\nsons to whom this had happened. There was always the \\n\\nreturn to their father and the path of righteousness that \\n\\nwas so fine and redeeming that I felt convinced that this \\n\\n9 \\n\\nDEMI AN \\n\\nalone was the right, good, worthy thing; and yet I found \\n\\nthe part of the story which was played among the wicked \\n\\nand lost souls far more, alluring. *If it had been per- \\n\\nmissible to speak out and confess, I should have admitted \\n\\nthat it often seemed a shame to me that the Prodigal \\n\\nSon should atone and be ‘found’ again — though this \\n\\nfeeling was only vaguely present deep down within me \\n\\nlike a presentiment or possibility. When I pictured the \\n\\ndevil to myself, I found no difficulty in visualizing him \\n\\nin the street below, disguised or undisguised, or at the \\n\\nfair or in a tavern but never at home. \\n\\nMy sisters belonged likewise to the world of light. It \\n\\noften seemed to me that they were closer in temperament \\n\\nto father and mother, better and more refined and with \\n\\nfewer faults than I. Of course they had their defects and \\n\\ntheir vagaries but these did not appear to me to go very \\n\\ndeep. It was not as with me whose contact with evil \\n\\ncould become so oppressive and painful and to whom \\n\\nthe dark world lay so much closer. My sisters, like my \\n\\nparents, were to be spared and respected, and if one \\n\\nquarrelled with them one always felt in the wrong after- \\n\\nwards; as if one were the instigator, who must crave \\n\\nforgiveness. For in offending my sisters, I was offending \\n\\nmy parents, which made me guilty of a breach of good \\n\\nconduct. There were secrets that I would have been less \\n\\nreluctant to tell the most reprobate street urchin than \\n\\nmy sisters. On good days when everything seemed light \\n\\nand my conscience in good order, I enjoyed playing \\n\\nwith them, being good and kind to them and seeing \\n\\nmyself sharing their aura of nobility. It was like a fore- \\n\\ntaste of being an angel I That was the highest thing we \\n\\n10 \\n\\nTWO WORLDS \\n\\ncould conceive of and we thought it would be sweet \\n\\nand wonderful to be angels, surrounded with sweet \\n\\nmusic and fragrance reminiscent of Christmas and happi- \\n\\nness. How rarely did such hours and days come along! \\n\\nI would often be engaged in some harmless and author- \\n\\nized game which became too exciting and vigorous for \\n\\nmy sisters and led to squabbles and misery, and when I \\n\\nlost my temper I was terrible and did and said things \\n\\nthat seemed so depraved to me that they seared my heart \\n\\neven as I was in the act of doing and saying them. These \\n\\noccasions were followed by gloomy hours of sorrow and \\n\\npenitence and the painful moment when I begged for- \\n\\ngiveness and then, once again, a beam of light, a tran- \\n\\nquil, grateful unclouded goodness for hours — or mom- \\n\\nents as the case might be. \\n\\nI attended the local grammar school. The mayor’s \\n\\nson and the head forester’s son were in my class and \\n\\nsometimes joined me. They were wild fellows, yet they \\n\\nbelonged to the ‘respectable’ world. But I also had dose \\n\\nrelations with neighbours’ sons, village lads on whom \\n\\nwe normally looked down. It is with one of these that \\n\\n\\n\\nmy story begins \\n\\nOne half-holiday — I was little more than ten years old \\n\\n— I was playing around with two boys from the neigh- \\n\\nbourhood. A bigger boy joined us, a rough, burly lad of \\n\\nabout thirteen from the village school, the tailor’s son. \\n\\nHis father drank, and the whole family had a bad name. \\n\\nI knew Franz Kromer well, and went about in fear of \\n\\nhim so that I felt very uneasy when he came along. He \\n\\nhad already acquired grown-up ways and imitated the \\n\\nwalk and speech of the young factory workers. With him \\n\\n11 \\n\\nDEMI AN \\n\\nas ringleader we climbed down the river bank near the \\n\\nbridge and hid ourselves away from the world under the \\n\\nfirst arch. The narrow strip between the vaulted bridge \\n\\nand the lazily flowing river consisted of nothing but \\n\\ngeneral rubbish and broken pots, tangles of rusty barbed \\n\\nwire and similar jetsam. Occasionally we came across \\n\\n\\n\\nthings we could make use of. We had to comb these \\n\\nstretches of bank under Franz Kromer’s orders and show \\n\\nhim our discoveries. These he either kept himself or \\n\\nthrew into the water. We were told to notice whether \\n\\nthere were any items made of lead, brass or tin He \\n\\nretained these together with an old comb made of horn. \\n\\nI was very uncomfortable in his presence, not because I \\n\\nknew my father would forbid this relationship but out \\n\\nof fear of Franz himself, but I was grateful for being \\n\\nincluded, and treated like the others. He gave the orders \\n\\nand we obeyed as if it was an old custom, although it \\n\\nwas my first time. \\n\\nAt length we sat down on the ground; Franz spat into \\n\\nthe water and looked like a grown-up; he spat through a \\n\\ngap between his teeth and scored a hit wherever he \\n\\naimed. A conversation started and the boys boasted \\n\\nabout their grand deeds and beastly tricks. I remained \\n\\nsilent and yet feared to offend by my silence and incur \\n\\nKromer’s wrath. Both my comrades had made up to \\n\\nhim, and avoided me from the start. I was a stranger \\n\\namong them and felt that my clothes and manners were \\n\\ntaken as a kind of challenge. Franz could not possibly \\n\\nhave any love for me, a grammar schoor boy and a \\n\\ngentleman’s son and I was in no doubt that the other \\n\\ntwo, if it came to it, would disown and desert me. \\n\\n\\n\\n12 \\n\\nTWO WORLDS \\n\\nFinally, out of sheer nervousness, I began to talk. I \\n\\ninvented a long story of robbery, in which I featured as \\n\\nthe hero. One night in the corner by the mill a friend \\n\\nand I had stolen a whole sackful of apples, not just \\n\\nordinary apples but pippins, golden pippins of the best \\n\\nkind at that. I was taking refuge in my story from the \\n\\ndangers of the moment and found no difficulty in invent- \\n\\ning and relating it. In order not to dry up too soon and \\n\\nperhaps become involved in something worse, I gave full \\n\\nrein to my narrative powers. One of us, I reported, had \\n\\nalways stood guard while the other sat in the tree and \\n\\nchucked the apples down, and the sack had got so heavy \\n\\nthat in the end we had to open it and leave half behind, \\n\\nbut we came back half an hour later and fetched them \\n\\ntoo. \\n\\nI hoped for some applause at the end of my story; I \\n\\n\\n\\nhad warmed up to the narrative at last, carried away by \\n\\nmy own eloquence. The two smaller boys were silent, \\n\\nwaiting, but Franz Kromer gave me a penetrating look \\n\\nthrough his narrowH. eyes. \"Is that yarn true?” he \\n\\nasked in a menacing tone. \\n\\n\"Yes,” I said. \\n\\n\"Really and truly?” \\n\\n“Yes, really and truly,” I asserted defiantly while I \\n\\nchoked inwardly with fear. \\n\\n\"Can you swear to it?” \\n\\nI was very afraid but I said ‘Yes’ without hesitation. \\n\\n\"Hand on your heart?” \\n\\n\"Hand on my heart;” \\n\\n\"Right then,” he said and turned away. \\n\\nI thought this was all very satisfactory and I was glad \\n\\n13 \\n\\n\\n\\nDE M I AN \\n\\nwhen he got up and turned to go home. When we were \\n\\non the bridge I ventured timidly that I must go home. \\n\\n\"No desperate hurry/’ Franz laughed. \"We go the \\n\\nsame way.\" \\n\\nHe sauntered along slowly and I did not dare to go \\n\\n.ahead, but he was in fact going in the direction of our \\n\\nhouse. When we arrived, and I saw our front door and \\n\\nthe fat doorknocker, the sun in the windows and the \\n\\ncurtains in my mother’s room, I breathed a sigh of \\n\\nrelief. Back home I O good, blessed home-coming back \\n\\nto the world of light and peace I \\n\\nWhen I had quickly opened the door and slipped in \\n\\nready to slam it behind me, Franz Kromer edged in too. \\n\\nIn the cool, gloomy paved passage which was lit solely \\n\\nfrom the courtyard he stood close to me and said in a \\n\\nlow voice, \"No hurry, you I ” \\n\\nI looked at him terrified. His grip on my arm was \\n\\nlike a vice. I tried to guess what was going on in his \\n\\nmind and whether he was going to do me some mischief. \\n\\nIf I were to let out a loud and vigorous shriek would \\n\\nsome one above be quick enough to save me? But I \\n\\ngave up the idea. \\n\\n“What is it?” I asked, “what do you want?” \\n\\n\"Oh nothing much, I merely wanted to ask you some- \\n\\nthing. The others needn’t hear.” \\n\\n\"Well? What do you want me to tell you? I must go \\n\\nup, you know.” \\n\\n“I suppose you know who owns the orchard by the \\n\\ncorner mill?” \\n\\n\"No, I don’t. The miller I think.” \\n\\nFranz had put his arm round me and drawn me close ', metadata={'source': './files/Demian test.docx'})]"
