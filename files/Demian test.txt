Prologue 


I cannot tell my story without going a long way back. 
If it were possible I would go back much farther still to 
the very earliest years of my childhood and beyond them 
to my family origins. 

When poets write novels they are apt to behave as if 
they were gods, with the power to look beyond and com- 
prehend any human story and serve it up as if the 
Almighty himself, omnipresent, were relating it in all 
its naked truth. That I am no more able to do than the 
poets. But my story is more important to me than any 
poet’s story to him, for it is my own — and it is the story 
of a human being — not an invented, idealised person 
but a real, live, unique being. What constitutes a real, 
live human being is more of a mystery than ever these 
days, and men — each one of whom is a valuable, unique 
experiment on the part of nature — are shot down whole- 
sale. If, however, we were not something more than 
unique human beings and each man jack of us could 
really be dismissed from this world with a bullet, there 
would be no more point in relating stories at all. But 
evcpy man is not only himself; he is also the unique, 
particular, always significant and remarkable point 
where the phenomena of the world intersect once and 
for all and never again. That is why every man’s story 


5 



DEMIAN 


is important, eternal, sacred; and why every man while 
he lives and fulfils the will of nature is a wonderful 
creature, deserving the utmost attention. In each indi- 
vidual the spirit is made -flesh, in each one the whole of 
creation suffers, in each one a Saviour is crucified. 

Few people nowadays know what man is. Many feel it 
intuitively and die more easily for that reason, just as I 
shall die more easily when I have completed this story. 

I cannot call myself a scholar. I have always been and 
still am a seeker but I no longer do my seeking among 
the stars or in books. I am beginning to hear the lessons 
which whisper in my blood. Mine is not a pleasant story, 
it does not possess the gentle harmony of invented tales; 
like the lives of all men who have given up trying to 
deceive themselves, it is a mixture of nonsense and 
chaos, madness and dreams. 

The life of every man is a way to himself, an attempt 
at a way, the suggestion of a path. No man has ever 
been utterly himself, yet every man strives to be so, the 
dull, the intelligent, each one as best he can. Each man 
to the end of his days carries round with him vestiges 
of his birth — the slime and egg-shells of the primeval 
world. There are many who never become human; they 
remain frogs, lizards, ants. Many men are human beings 
above and fish below. Yet each one represents an attempt 
on the part of nature to create a human being. We 
enjoy a common origin in our mothers; we all come 
from the same pit. But each individual, who is himself 
an experimental throw from the depths, strives towards 
his own goal. We can understand each other; but each 
person is able to interpret himself to himself alone.

I 


Two Worlds 


I begin my story with an event from the time when I 
was ten years old, attending the local grammar school 
in our small country town. 

I can still catch the fragrance of many things which 
stir me with feelings of melancholy and send delicious 
shivers of delight through me — dark and sunlit streets, 
houses and towers, clock chimes and people’s faces, rooms 
full of comfort and warm hospitality, rooms full of 
secret and profound, ghostly fears. It is a world that 
savours of warm corners, rabbits, servant girls, household 
remedies and dried fruit. It was the meeting-place of two 
worlds; day and night came thither from two opposite 
poles. 

There was the world of my parents' house, or rather it 
was even more circumscribed and embraced only my 
parents themselves. This world was familiar to me in 
almost every aspect — it meant mother and father, love 
and severity, model behaviour and school. It was a world 
of quiet brilliance, clarity and cleanliness; in it gentle 
and friendly conversation, washed hands, clean clothes 
and good manners were the order of the day. In this 
world the morning hymn was sung, Christmas celebrated. 
Through it ran straight lines and paths that led into the 
future; here were duty and guilt, bad conscience and 


7 




DEMI AN 


confessions, forgiveness and good resolutions, love and 
reverence, wisdom and Bible readings. In this world you 
had to conduct yourself so that life should be pure, 
unsullied, beautiful and Well-ordered. 

The other world, however, also began in the middle 
of our own house and was completely different; it smelt 
different, spoke a different language, made different 
claims and promises. This second world was peopled 
with servant girls and workmen, ghost stories and scan- 
dalous rumours, a gay tide of monstrous, intriguing, 
frightful, mysterious things; it included the slaughter- 
house and the prison, drunken and scolding women, 
cows in labour, foundered horses, tales of housebreaking, 
murder and suicide. All these attractive and hideous, 
wild and cruel things were on every side, in the next 
street, the neighbouring house. Policemen and tramps 
moved about in it, drunkards beat their wives, bunches 
of young women poured out of the factories in the even- 
ing, old women could put a spell on you and make you 
ill; thieves lived in the wood; incendiaries were caught 
by mounted gendarmes. Everywhere you could smell this 
vigorous, second world — everywhere, that is, except in 
our house where my mother and father lived. There it 
was all goodness. It was wonderful to be living in a 
house in a reign of peace, order, tranquillity, duty and 
good conscience, forgiveness and love — but it was no less 
wonderful to know there was the other, the loud and 
shrill, sullen and violent world from which you could 
dart back to your mother in one leap. 

The odd thing about it was that these worlds should 
border on each other so closely. When, for example, our

servant Lina sat by the door in the living-room at even- 
ing prayers and joined in the hymn in her dear voice, 
her freshly washed hands folded on her smoothed down 
pinafore, she belonged wholly and utterly to mother 
and father, to us, the world of light and righteousness. 
But when in the kitchen or woodshed immediately after- 
wards she told me the story of the little headless man or 
started bickering with her neighbours in the little 
butcher’s shop, she became a different person, belonged 
to another world and was veiled in mystery. And it was 
the same with everybody, most of all with myself. Doubt- 
less I was part of the world of light and righteousness 
as the child of my parents, but wherever I listened or 
directed my gaze I found the other thing and I lived 
half in the other world, although it was often strangely 
alien to me and I inevitably suffered from panic and a 
bad conscience. Indeed at times I preferred life in the 
forbidden world and my return to the world of light — 
necessary and worthy though it might be — was often 
almost like a return something less attractive, some- 
thing both more drab and tedious. I was often conscious 
that my destiny in life was to become like my father 
and mother; pure, righteous and disciplined; but that 
was a long way ahead; first one had to sit studying at 
school, do tests and examinations, and the way always 
led through and past the other, dark world and it was 
not impossible that one might remain permanently in 
it. I had read, with passionate interest, stories of prodigal 
sons to whom this had happened. There was always the 
return to their father and the path of righteousness that 
was so fine and redeeming that I felt convinced that this

DEMI AN 


alone was the right, good, worthy thing; and yet I found 
the part of the story which was played among the wicked 
and lost souls far more, alluring. *If it had been per- 
missible to speak out and confess, I should have admitted 
that it often seemed a shame to me that the Prodigal 
Son should atone and be ‘found’ again — though this 
feeling was only vaguely present deep down within me 
like a presentiment or possibility. When I pictured the 
devil to myself, I found no difficulty in visualizing him 
in the street below, disguised or undisguised, or at the 
fair or in a tavern but never at home. 

My sisters belonged likewise to the world of light. It 
often seemed to me that they were closer in temperament 
to father and mother, better and more refined and with 
fewer faults than I. Of course they had their defects and 
their vagaries but these did not appear to me to go very 
deep. It was not as with me whose contact with evil 
could become so oppressive and painful and to whom 
the dark world lay so much closer. My sisters, like my 
parents, were to be spared and respected, and if one 
quarrelled with them one always felt in the wrong after- 
wards; as if one were the instigator, who must crave 
forgiveness. For in offending my sisters, I was offending 
my parents, which made me guilty of a breach of good 
conduct. There were secrets that I would have been less 
reluctant to tell the most reprobate street urchin than 
my sisters. On good days when everything seemed light 
and my conscience in good order, I enjoyed playing 
with them, being good and kind to them and seeing 
myself sharing their aura of nobility. It was like a fore- 
taste of being an angel I That was the highest thing we 


10 



TWO WORLDS 


could conceive of and we thought it would be sweet 
and wonderful to be angels, surrounded with sweet 
music and fragrance reminiscent of Christmas and happi- 
ness. How rarely did such hours and days come along! 

I would often be engaged in some harmless and author- 
ized game which became too exciting and vigorous for 
my sisters and led to squabbles and misery, and when I 
lost my temper I was terrible and did and said things 
that seemed so depraved to me that they seared my heart 
even as I was in the act of doing and saying them. These 
occasions were followed by gloomy hours of sorrow and 
penitence and the painful moment when I begged for- 
giveness and then, once again, a beam of light, a tran- 
quil, grateful unclouded goodness for hours — or mom- 
ents as the case might be. 

I attended the local grammar school. The mayor’s 
son and the head forester’s son were in my class and 
sometimes joined me. They were wild fellows, yet they 
belonged to the ‘respectable’ world. But I also had dose 
relations with neighbours’ sons, village lads on whom 
we normally looked down. It is with one of these that 
my story begins 

One half-holiday — I was little more than ten years old 
— I was playing around with two boys from the neigh- 
bourhood. A bigger boy joined us, a rough, burly lad of 
about thirteen from the village school, the tailor’s son. 
His father drank, and the whole family had a bad name. 
I knew Franz Kromer well, and went about in fear of 
him so that I felt very uneasy when he came along. He 
had already acquired grown-up ways and imitated the 
walk and speech of the young factory workers. With him

DEMI AN 


as ringleader we climbed down the river bank near the 
bridge and hid ourselves away from the world under the 
first arch. The narrow strip between the vaulted bridge 
and the lazily flowing river consisted of nothing but 
general rubbish and broken pots, tangles of rusty barbed 
wire and similar jetsam. Occasionally we came across 
things we could make use of. We had to comb these 
stretches of bank under Franz Kromer’s orders and show 
him our discoveries. These he either kept himself or 
threw into the water. We were told to notice whether 
there were any items made of lead, brass or tin He 
retained these together with an old comb made of horn. 
I was very uncomfortable in his presence, not because I 
knew my father would forbid this relationship but out 
of fear of Franz himself, but I was grateful for being 
included, and treated like the others. He gave the orders 
and we obeyed as if it was an old custom, although it 
was my first time. 

At length we sat down on the ground; Franz spat into 
the water and looked like a grown-up; he spat through a 
gap between his teeth and scored a hit wherever he 
aimed. A conversation started and the boys boasted 
about their grand deeds and beastly tricks. I remained 
silent and yet feared to offend by my silence and incur 
Kromer’s wrath. Both my comrades had made up to 
him, and avoided me from the start. I was a stranger 
among them and felt that my clothes and manners were 
taken as a kind of challenge. Franz could not possibly 
have any love for me, a grammar schoor boy and a 
gentleman’s son and I was in no doubt that the other 
two, if it came to it, would disown and desert me.

TWO WORLDS 


Finally, out of sheer nervousness, I began to talk. I 
invented a long story of robbery, in which I featured as 
the hero. One night in the corner by the mill a friend 
and I had stolen a whole sackful of apples, not just 
ordinary apples but pippins, golden pippins of the best 
kind at that. I was taking refuge in my story from the 
dangers of the moment and found no difficulty in invent- 
ing and relating it. In order not to dry up too soon and 
perhaps become involved in something worse, I gave full 
rein to my narrative powers. One of us, I reported, had 
always stood guard while the other sat in the tree and 
chucked the apples down, and the sack had got so heavy 
that in the end we had to open it and leave half behind, 
but we came back half an hour later and fetched them 
too. 

I hoped for some applause at the end of my story; I 
had warmed up to the narrative at last, carried away by 
my own eloquence. The two smaller boys were silent, 
waiting, but Franz Kromer gave me a penetrating look 
through his narrowH. eyes. "Is that yarn true?” he 
asked in a menacing tone. 

"Yes,” I said. 

"Really and truly?” 

“Yes, really and truly,” I asserted defiantly while I 
choked inwardly with fear. 

"Can you swear to it?” 

I was very afraid but I said ‘Yes’ without hesitation. 

"Hand on your heart?” 

"Hand on my heart;” 

"Right then,” he said and turned away. 

I thought this was all very satisfactory and I was glad

when he got up and turned to go home. When we were 
on the bridge I ventured timidly that I must go home. 

"No desperate hurry/’ Franz laughed. "We go the 
same way." 

He sauntered along slowly and I did not dare to go 
.ahead, but he was in fact going in the direction of our 
house. When we arrived, and I saw our front door and 
the fat doorknocker, the sun in the windows and the 
curtains in my mother’s room, I breathed a sigh of 
relief. Back home I O good, blessed home-coming back 
to the world of light and peace I 

When I had quickly opened the door and slipped in 
ready to slam it behind me, Franz Kromer edged in too. 
In the cool, gloomy paved passage which was lit solely 
from the courtyard he stood close to me and said in a 
low voice, "No hurry, you I ” 

I looked at him terrified. His grip on my arm was 
like a vice. I tried to guess what was going on in his 
mind and whether he was going to do me some mischief. 
If I were to let out a loud and vigorous shriek would 
some one above be quick enough to save me? But I 
gave up the idea. 

“What is it?” I asked, “what do you want?” 

"Oh nothing much, I merely wanted to ask you some- 
thing. The others needn’t hear.” 

"Well? What do you want me to tell you? I must go 
up, you know.” 

“I suppose you know who owns the orchard by the 
corner mill?” 

"No, I don’t. The miller I think.” 

Franz had put his arm round me and drawn me close
